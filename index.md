# Welcome

This webpage is meant to display my progress as a developer. I want to showcase projects and experiments that I complete outside of my professional work. Currently the list is small, but hopefully in time, it will expand.

## Projects List
These are the personal projects that I have been working on.


### Toxic Comment Classifier
I have wrote a toxic comment classifier for a competition posted on [Kaggle](kaggle.com). This classifier uses Wikipedia comments that are categorized into any of the following categories: toxic, severe toxic, insult, obscene, threat or identity hate. The classifier uses this data to train itself and produces probabilities that a new comment falls into each of the listed categories.

### Advent of Code 2017
I have been working through the 25 challenges for the 2017 Advent of Code. The solutions are written in Python 3.6 and large input files are format as plain .txt files.
